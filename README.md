# Portfolio — Engineer of the North

This is a small TypeScript + React + Vite portfolio scaffold with a dark, Game-of-Thrones-inspired aesthetic. It portrays the author as a northern-style engineer (in spirit) and provides pages for Home, About, Projects, Contact, and Links.

Getting started (Windows `cmd.exe`):

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

3. Open the address shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- This project is a starting scaffold. Replace placeholder text, emails, and project links with your real content.
- The design is "inspired" by medieval / northerly aesthetics without using copyrighted assets.
